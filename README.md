# E-Commerce-Database-Project-with-Microsoft-SQL

In this project work, I have created an E-Commerce-Database-Project-with-Microsoft-SQL for a Laptop and Desktop computer company. 
The database has a total of 12 tables some of the tables includes customer table, payment table, phone table, product_catalog table, vendor table among others.

I have also provided the script for the database design including the script to populate the database and EER diagram.
